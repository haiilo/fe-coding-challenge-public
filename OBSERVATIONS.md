## ui

Categories are buttons. There is a message with the category clicked by user. The drawback is that there is no visual distinction when mouse is moved over the 'category' button, the 'cursor' mouse pointer being displayed for both.

Because cards have a min width, a max width is also necessary. Otherwise there is only one column with cards.

## service

Because this is a demo application, there are some messages that are displayed and (some may) have no sense in production. The purpose of them is to make the review process much easier.
  - page number message for current request
  - error message in case a new page of products can not be obtained. 
  - no more products message
