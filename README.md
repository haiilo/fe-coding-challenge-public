## About project

> A [Nx](https://nx.dev/) integrated monorepo workspace with [Angular](https://angular.io/) consuming [Standalone API](https://angular.io/guide/standalone-components), Dynamic Module Federation, [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/), [NgRx](https://ngrx.io/), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/), [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/), [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). All of those, and more, orchestrated in a push-based architecture.
>
> All UI components were built for this project, but to be noted that having in mind a faster pace those components were not meant to reach production without further polishing.
>
> This project was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev/).
